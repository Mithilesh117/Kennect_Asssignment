1.4 Explain jwt in approx and prove its top 3 benifits

1. Jwt is combination of header, payload and signature.
2. It is a method of securely transfering a data between two parties.
3. Jwt uses a public key and private key for encryption and decryption of the data.
4. It is a method which symmetrically signed by a shared secret key by using a private key.
5. We use to for authentication such as in website or mobile applications.
6. This method may have build in expiry machanism as per demand 

Benifits

1. To authenticate a user, a client  application must send a JSON web token(JWT) in the authorization header of the HTTP 
request to your backend API.API gateway validates the token on the behalf of your api, so you dont have to add any code
in your api to process the authentication

2. The use of the tokens has many benifits compared to traditional method such as cookies. tokens are stateless. the token
is self-contained and contains all the information it needs for authentication.

3. Can be used across services and specifically be isolated in an authorization micro - service that can create these tokens
the rest of the microsrvices can just have the public key to verify the signature of the tokens
